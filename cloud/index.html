										<p>Every business these days is under pressure to do more with a smaller budget and in such circumstances there’s pressure to maximize the return on investment throughout the entire operation. Cloud helps you achieve this. Be it a single application or an all in approach, Pentacle can be your guide and support during your journey to the cloud.</p>
<p>As a 1 Tier Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider, we bring your the following products and services at affordable cost and in pay as you grow model:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Microsoft Azure Deployment, Migration and Support Services</span></strong><br />
Microsoft Azure is the public cloud offering from Microsoft and includes integrated tools, pre-built templates and managed services that make it easier to build and manage enterprise, mobile, Web and Internet of Things (IoT) apps faster, using skills you already have and technologies you already know.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also the only vendor positioned as a Leader across Gartner’s Magic Quadrants for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, Application Platform as a Service, and Cloud Storage Services for the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>Azure supports the broadest selection of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases and devices. Run Linux containers with Docker integration; build apps with JavaScript, Python, .NET, PHP, Java and Node.js; build back-ends for iOS, Android and Windows devices. Azure supports the same technologies millions of developers and IT professionals already rely on and trust.</p>
<p>Our expertise on Microsoft Azure includes below technologies:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #333300;">Virtual Machines:</span></strong><br />
Azure Virtual Machines lets you deploy a wide range of computing solutions in an agile way. Deploy a virtual machine nearly instantly, and pay by the minute. With support for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM, SAP, and Azure BizTalk Services, you can deploy any workload and any language on nearly any operating system.</p>
<p>Develop, package, and deploy powerful applications and services to the cloud with Azure Cloud Services and the click of a button. Scale from 1 to 1000 in minutes. Once your application is deployed, that’s it: from provisioning, to load-balancing, to health monitoring, Azure handles the rest. Your application is backed by an industry-leading 99.95% monthly SLA.</p>
<p><strong>App Services:</strong><br />
Code in your favorite language and IDE – .NET, NodeJS, PHP, Python, or Java – to build web apps and APIs faster than ever. Be more agile with continuous integration using Visual Studio Team Services or GitHub and with live-site debugging. Easily scale applications on-demand with high availability.</p>
<p>Build engaging mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows. Easily add corporate sign-on, and securely connect to on-premises resources. Create robust apps that remain useful when there are network issues, so users can create and modify data even when they are offline. Broadcast personalized push notifications to millions in minutes.</p>
<p>Automate business processes fast with a visual design experience for business processes and workflows. Integrate with your SaaS and enterprise applications with out-of-box connectivity to dozens of cloud-based services and enterprise applications. Enterprise ready with Biztalk capabilities for automating EAI/B2B and business process.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong><br />
Azure Storage provides the flexibility and hyper-scale needed to store and retrieve large amounts of data. Use Azure Blob Storage to store unstructured data, such as documents and media files, Azure Table Storage to store structured NoSQL data, and Azure Queue Storage to reliably store messages. Use SMB-based Azure File Storage for existing or new applications &#8211; no code changes are required.</p>
<p>Storage keeps up with your growing data needs, with up to 500 TB of total storage per account. A single subscription supports up to 50 storage accounts, delivering petabytes of storage for the largest scenarios. Whether you&#8217;re building a consumer site or a terabyte-scale big data application, Azure is designed to handle it.</p>
<p>Storage automatically replicates your data to help guard against unexpected hardware failures and ensure that your data is available when you need it. We keep 3 copies within a single region. For higher availability and disaster recover, a geo-redundancy option creates 3 additional copies hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p><strong>Backup:</strong><br />
Your data and applications are everywhere—on servers, clients, and in the cloud. Backup can protect your critical applications, including SharePoint, Exchange, and SQL Server; files and folders; Windows servers and clients; and Azure infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) virtual machines.</p>
<p>Due to business or compliance requirements, organizations are required to protect their data for years, and over time this data grows exponentially. Traditionally, tape has been used for long-term retention. Backup provides a compelling alternative to tape with significant cost savings, shorter recovery times, and up to 99 years of retention.</p>
<p>Your backup data is secure over the wire and at rest. The backup data is stored in geo-replicated storage which maintains 6 copies of your data across two Azure datacenters. With 99.9% service availability, Backup provides operational peace of mind.</p>
<p>Backup is efficient over the network and on your disk. Once the initial seeding is complete, only incremental changes are sent at a defined frequency. Built-in features, such as compression, encryption, longer retention, and bandwidth throttling, help boost IT efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Site Recovery:</strong><br />
Your environment can be protected by automating the replication of the virtual machines based on policies that you set and control. Site Recovery can protect Hyper-V, VMware and physical servers and you can use Azure or your secondary datacenter as your recovery site. Site Recovery coordinates and manages the ongoing replication of data by integrating with existing technologies including System Center and SQL Server AlwaysOn.</p>
<p>Automate the orderly recovery of services in the event of a site outage at the primary datacenter with Site Recovery. Bring over applications in an orchestrated way to help restore service quickly, even for complex multi-tier workloads. Easily create disaster recovery plans in the Azure management portal, where they are stored. The disaster recovery plans can be as simple or as advanced as your business requirements demand, including the execution of custom Windows PowerShell scripts and Azure Automation Runbooks, and pauses for manual interventions. Customize networks by mapping virtual networks between the primary and recovery sites, and test disaster recovery plans whenever you want without disrupting the services at your primary location.</p>
<p>Replicating your workloads to Azure enables new capabilities. Applications can be Migrated to Azure with just a few clicks, or burst to Azure temporarily when you encounter a surge in demand. Run reports and analytics on copies of production workloads in Azure without impacting users. DevTest new versions of applications with copies of live data, and then seamlessly put the new version into production in your datacenter.</p>
<p>Site Recovery monitors the state of your protected instances continuously and remotely from Azure. When replicating between two sites you control, your virtual machines’ data and replication remains on your networks. All communication with Azure is encrypted. When replicating to Azure as the secondary site, your data is encrypted and you can also select encryption for data at-rest.</p>
<p>Other Azure technologies on which the customers can work with us are as below:</p>
<p>Managed SQL Database Services<br />
Internet of Things<br />
Media and CDN Services</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Microsoft Office 365 Deployment, Migration and Support Services</span></strong><br />
